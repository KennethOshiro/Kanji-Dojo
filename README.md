### Project details

Used libraries: `Compose Multiplatform`, `Kotlin Coroutines`, `Koin`, `SqlDelight` 

Most parts of the app are implemented in the `core` multiplatform module. The `app` module only contains some specific parts for the Fdroid and Google Play versions (flavors)

Under the main package path there are 2 different packages: 
* `core` - contains app's general logic for features like repositories, databases, app state managers and handlers
* `presentation` - contains UI, navigation logic, screen specific logic and use cases

Typically a feature under `core` package is placed in a separate package and consist of an interface and implementation. 

The `presentation` package contains common UI and screen infrastructure. A single screen contains:
* `<ScreenName>Contract` - an interface with screen's view model and screen state data
* `<ScreenName>ViewModel` - handles screen's logic
* `<ScreenName><Action>UseCase` - components that handle some specific action, invoked by view model
* `<ScreenName>Screen` composable that handles navigation and communication between UI and view model
* `<ScreenName>UI` - composable function that represents UI, it depends only on data so it can be covered by previews
* `<ScreenName>Module` - a koin module that defines how to provide all screen specific components. 
</br>**Note:** View models should be additionally registered in `androidViewModelModule` since on android they're additionally wrapped by a platform specific component
* (Optional) `Content` interface for screens that can be replaced in flavors, like `SettingsScreenContract.Content`

There is a single Koin's `module` for all features under `core` package, but there are also separate modules for a platform (`platformComponentsModule`) and flavor (`flavorModule`) specific features. All screens have their own koin modules
